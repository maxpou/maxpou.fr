## Hello World!

Hey, I'm **Maxence Poutord**, a passionate software engineer, technical speaker, blogger and
[mentor](https://mentors.codingcoach.io/?name=Maxence+Poutord). I started coding
[at the age of 11](https://twitter.com/_maxpou/status/771701472199340032) with the QBasic language.
+20 years later, I'm still coding! My expertise lies primarily in the development of web
applications. I was also involved in hiring at most of the organisations I work for, interviewing
candidates and helping HR make decisions.

After 2 years as an expat in Dublin, I became a digital nomad. I started working and living where
the WiFi and the sun are (Europe and Southeast Asia). I'm now based in Paris and I still work
remotely.

  application (NestJS);

- **🏎 Performances**.

## What I do for fun

  dal. Some of my recipes are online
- 🧗🏻 **Sport**. I mostly Run, hike and cycle. I'm also a canyoning guide!
- 🍺 Appreciate a Gin or a **pint of beer** (IPA/NEIPA).

  something new!

- 👨🏼‍💻 **Play with code**. Sometimes, it ends up in an open-source contribution or a blog post!

## Why this blog?

I started this blog in 2014 because I wanted to keep track of my experiements. At the beginning, it
was all private. I learnt a lot on the internets so, I realised I had to give something back to the
community. That's why, I decided to make it public to share my knowledge with the world.

**My site has no ads, sponsored content or bullshit. It is my blog, my content and my ideas.**
