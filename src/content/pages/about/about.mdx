## Hello World!

Hey, I'm **Maxence Poutord**, a passionate software encgineer, technical speaker, blogger and
[mentor](https://mentors.codingcoach.io/?name=Maxence+Poutord).

I [wrote my first line of code](https://twitter.com/_maxpou/status/771701472199340032) at age 11 (in
QBasic!). More than 20 years later, I'm still coding! My expertise lies primarily in the development
of web applications. I was also involved in hiring at most of the organisations I work for,
interviewing candidates and helping HR make decisions.

My journey has taken me from being an expat in Dublin to a digital nomad across Europe and Southeast
Asia. Today, I am happily settled in Paris, working remotely with an international team.

## What I do for a living

I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at Orderfox where I am building software for the CNC
industry. I'm focusing on:

- **🏗 Cloud & App Architecture**: Designing React (TS, Tailwind) and Node.js (NestJS) systems,
  managing containerized deployments on AWS/Azure.
- **🚦 Quality & DevEx**: Improving Developer Experience via CI/CD and automated testing (Jest,
  Cypress, Testing Library).
- **👨‍🦯 Accessibility:** Enforcing strict a11y standards.
- **🏎 Performances**: Optimizing application speed and Core Web Vitals.

## What I do for fun

- ✈️ **Travel**. Often.
- 👨‍🍳 **Cooking**. [I cook](/recipes) food from all over the world, from Italian Pizza to Indian Dal.
- 🧗🏻 **Sports**. I run (+100km/month), hike and cycle. I'm also a canyoning guide!
- 🍺 **Craft Drinks**. Appreciate a good Gin or a pint of craft beer (IPA/NEIPA).
- 🕹 **Gaming**. I'm a big Age of Empires 2 fan (a 20-year-old game!)
- 👨🏼‍💻 **Side Projects**: I build apps for fun. You can find my latest experiments on
  [my portfolio](/portfolio), or read about them on my blog.
- 🗣 **Community.** I enjoy sharing knowledge as a [Tech trainer](./speaking#trainings--workshops)
  and [public speaker](./speaking).

## Why this blog?

I started this blog in 2014 because I wanted to keep track of my experiments. At the beginning, it
was all private. I learnt a lot on the Internet so, I realised I had to give something back to the
community. That's why, I decided to make it public to share my knowledge with the world.

**My site has no ads, sponsored content or bullshit. It is my blog, my content and my ideas.**
