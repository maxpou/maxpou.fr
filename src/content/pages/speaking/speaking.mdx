I love to deliver technical talks. If you want to hear me, just
[contact me](mailto:maxence.poutord@gmail.com?subject=Speaking+Inquiry).

I can give presentations on the following areas:

- **Vue.js**: I have experience building medium-big sized Vue.js Application;
- **Progressive Web Apps** (PWA) and **Offline patterns**. How to take leverage of new browser
  capabilities. Building offline first applications.
- **Accessibility (A11y)**: I worked on application accessibility (A11Y) to meet AA criteria (WCAG);
- **Performances**: how to manage your frontend performances and sleep at night;
- **Testing**: how to effectively test your Vue/React application and how to introduce a "Testing
  culture" in teams.
