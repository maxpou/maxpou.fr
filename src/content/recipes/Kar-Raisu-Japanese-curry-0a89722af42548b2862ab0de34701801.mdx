This curry is traditionally made with chicken (fried) but I prefer this vegetarian version.

## Ingredients

- 3/4 potatoes
- 3 carrots
- 2 onions
- 100g of mushrooms (brown or shiitake)
- 1 apple
- Soy sauce (4 spoons)
- 2-3 garlic cloves
- 50g flour / 50g butter
- curry powder, garam masala
- 1 spoon of tomato paste
- Water (1.5L) with chicken stock
- Rice

## Steps

**The roux**:

I recommend starting this step while the stew cook. In a pot, melt the butter. Once it’s melted, add
the flour. Cook for 2 minutes and then, add the tomato paste and the spices. You should have
something that looks like a paste.

**The curry:**

1. Finely dice the onion. The potatoes/carrots should be cut into large pieces. Like ~3cm.
2. In a pot, put some neutral oil. Once it’s hot, add the onion and cook for ~3mins.
3. Add all the veggies and the water
4. Simmer for 10 minutes (you can start preparing the roux)
5. Add the roux, grated apple and the soy sauce
6. Simmer for ~30 minutes
7. Serve with rice

## Variant

- peas
- chicken
