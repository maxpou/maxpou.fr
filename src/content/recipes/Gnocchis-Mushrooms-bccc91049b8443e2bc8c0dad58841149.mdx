## Ingredients: (4 persons)

For the Gnocchis:

- 1kg of potatoes
- ~300g of flour
- 2 eggs yolk
- olive oil
- nutmeg (optional), salt

For the recipe:

- 400g of mushroom. Preferably Chanterelles but Brown are fine too.
- 2 garlic cloves
- Parmesan cheese
- parsley (for the colour), salt, and pepper.

## Steps - Gnocchis

1. put the potatoes in the oven for ~40 minutes. Side note: cooking potatoes in a pan with water is
   not recommended because we want to avoid water as much as possible.
2. Mash the potatoes (with a ricer if you have one).
3. Add the yolks, salt, nutmeg, 200g of flour and 2 spoons of olive oil. Then mix everything.
4. Add the rest of the flour until you have a firm dough. Note: youâ€™re not making bread. Itâ€™s normal
   if the dough is slightly sticky!
5. Roll the sought until you have a snake shape and then cut it into equal pieces.
6. In a large pot of salted water, add the gnocchis. Cooking gnocchis goes really fast, thereâ€™s no
   need to put them all together at the same time! Boil until they float to the surface. Remove them
   with a wok skimmer.
7. Keep the boiling water!

> ðŸ’¡ If you make too many gnocchis, you can freeze them. But you will have to put them in cold water
> first, so they stop being cooked.

## Steps

1. Put some butter in a hot and large pan
2. add the minced garlic, and cook for 30 seconds
3. add mushrooms. If you went with brown mushrooms, cut them into 4/6 pieces.
4. when the mushrooms are ready, add the gnocchi to the pan.
5. add the grated cheese. Be generous!
6. add some boiling water from the gnocchis pot. Start with 1 ladle and add more if needed.
7. when you have the right consistency for the sauce, add the parsley and some pepper
8. serve! (you can add extra grated cheese)
