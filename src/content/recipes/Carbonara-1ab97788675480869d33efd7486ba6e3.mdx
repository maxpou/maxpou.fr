## Ingredients (2 persons)

- 120g Guanciale (pork’s pig jowls)
- 100g Pecorino (alternative 75% pecorino + 25% parmigiano reggiano)
- 1 egg + 2 yolks
- 300g of spaghettis (alternative: rigatoni, tonnarelli)
- black pepper

## Steps

1. Cook the pasta - Keep the “1L water + 1g salt = 100g pasta” ratio. Pasta should be firm.
2. While the pasta are cooking, cut guanciale in small cubes (< 1cm) or in thick batons.
3. Finely grate the cheese.
4. In a bowl, add the eggs, pepper and the cheese. Mix everything together.
5. In a cold pan, add the guanciale and start the heat. Slowly, as we don’t want to fry it.
6. When the pasta are cooked. Keep reserve some water. Transfer them into the sauce bowl with the
   guanciale. Add a little cooking water and mix well. Add more water if needed. This step can also
   be done in the pan. But we don’t want scrambled eggs. So, make sure the pan is not too hot.
7. Serve with grated parmesan and an extra twist of pepper.
