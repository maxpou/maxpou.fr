_Disclaimer: I mostly wrote this blog post for myself. Writing my
[Year in review](/tags/Year%20In%20Review) helps me to celebrate my biggest wins, see what was wrong
and define goals for the upcoming year._

## 👨‍💻 Work

After 3y at VSware, I felt it was time for me to move on. Less than 6 months after joining this
company, they allowed me to be remote and work wherever I wanted. It allows me to travel the world
while working. I am forever thankful!

Last May, I joined Orderfox as a Senior Software Engineer. During the interview, I was seduced by
the idea of working for a company that might not reach the end of the year. I thought it could be a
good opportunity to learn more about startups and how to focus on what matters. 3 months later, the
company got a 9.3€ million investment!  
I work with technologies I like. React on the frontend and Node.js on the backend. A month ago, we
started adding TypeScript and GraphQL.

Oh, I forgot, it's a fully remote job 🥳  
To be honest, I don't see myself going back to an office anytime soon.

## ✍️ Blog & Side projects

This year wasn't very prolific, but I did write 5 posts. Well, 4 if I remove my 2020 Year in Review
post! But I had pretty decent feedback from Reddit. My post about
_["Lessons Learned by Maintaining a Large Codebase"](/lesson-learned-maintaining-large-vue-js-codebase)_
reached the top page of Reddit.

I also did some improvements to my blog:

- ditched Disqus in favour of webmentions;
- ditched Google Analytics in favour of Plausible. A privacy-friendly Google Analytics alternative.

## Focus for 2022

Early 2021, I kind of abandoned all the goals I set for the remaining year. I started focusing on
myself. For 2022, I got a similar mindset:

- spending more time with the people I care about;
- exercise more;
- work smarter - Better invest my time, get better ergonomics.
