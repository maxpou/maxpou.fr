    description: `
      I'm Maxence, a French Software Engineer with 10 years of experience developing web-based applications. 
      I am a dedicated, hardworking, ambitious person that gets things done, both on my own initiative and within a team. 
      I enjoy challenges and I am not afraid of getting my hands dirty.
      Because knowledge sharing matters to me, I spend a non-negligible part of my time sharing things through blog posts, mentoring sessions or conferences.
