A few years back, I thought e2e tests they were slow and expensive... I think it a relic of an old
concept call [testing-pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html), I
learn back in the days. Fortunatelly, writting e2e test in 2022 is faster than 20years ago when this
concept was created. Mostly with Cypress.

Cypress is probably one of the most popular e2e testing framework. I have been using it for over a
year now

It's fast and feel confidend to see the result in a real browser.

Let say I have a `login.spec.js` file,

```js
it('should login', () => {
  cy.visit('/login')
  cy.get('[data-testid=login-username]').type('maxence')
  cy.get('[data-testid=login-password]').type('mycoolpassword')
  cy.get('[data-testid=login-login-btn]').click()
})
```

## Testing-library + Cypress = ❤️

When I started using it with testing-library, it was even better.

```js
it('should login', () => {
  cy.visit('/login')
  cy.findByPlaceholderText('Username').type('maxence')
  cy.findByPlaceholderText('password').type('mycoolpassword')
  cy.findByRole('button', { name: /Login/i }).click()
})
```
