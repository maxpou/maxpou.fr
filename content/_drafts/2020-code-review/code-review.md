# Code review guide lines

## Benefits of PR

* Discuss about the code: I have a problem, this is how I solved it;
* Spot potentials bugs;
* Discuss about the architecture

Be a better developper. Reading code is probably the best way to improve your coding skills!

## Definition of Done

**Author**
* 1 issue, 1 PR.
* All CI steps MUST be green: build/
* minimum 2 approvals before merge.
  * more reviewers don’t necessarily mean fewer defects
  * more reviewers spend less time
* UI/UX changes? add screenshots/capture. Need a tool for video recording? Use [Giphy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/giphy-capture-the-gif-maker/id668208984)!

**Reviewer**
* You don't see apparent bugs/regression;
* You understand the problem and how the author solved it. 
* You are able to maintain the code;
* You fully understand the code and the underlying changes;
* The pull request meet all requirements:
  * Naming: no variables called `var1`;
  * Comments: it's clear;
* No dead code or TODOs;
* Code is consistent with the rest of the application;
* Code is tested and documented.

If everything looks good to you, thumbed up/approve the Pull Request.

Have some doubt? `git pull` the code and test it locally!
(If so, you can add a message to prevent merge when you're testing it).

## Flow

1. Write code...
2. Open a pull request and assign it to yourself
3. Review your own code on Gitlab. Try to spot `console.debug`, `// dead code`...
4. Remove the WIP status. Make sure you filled the description field / the pull request template
5. Post it on the #codereviewrequests Slack channel
6. Get your 2 thumbs up and resolve conversation
7. Merge it

*Feel free to invert 1 and 2. Opening a PR before writing code is a good way to show your colleagues what you're working on!*

## Best practices

### For everybody

* Code review should be about code and only the code.
* Your opinion is not necessary everybody's opinion.
* PR are not a place to shine / show off with your coding skills.
* Final editorial control rests with the pull request author.
* Avoid ownership words ("mine", "not mine", "yours"). Once the code is merged, it's everybody's code. Not yours.
* Avoid statements words like "obviously", "everyone knows", "just"... something "simple" for you is not necessarily that simple for someone else.
* Favour one-to-one conversation
* [Respectful Reviews === Useful Reviews](https://testing.googleblog.com/2019/11/code-health-respectful-reviews-useful.html)
* You're not on a Reddit forum. Move philosophical/academic conversation to the weekly meeting ...or not!
* You are not your code.
* If you find something you like, **say it** 👏



### For the author

* Keep your PR as small as posible.
  > ask a programmer to review 10 lines of codes, they'll fill 10 issues
  > ask them to review 500 lines of code, they will say it looks good.
* Big change? communicate! If your PR includes big change (framework version...), the team must be aware!
* Try to respond to every comment.
* Don't do sneaky updates. Don't take leverage of a big pull request to force or hide a change. Same, don't add big changes after getting approvals! It's unfair!
* Provide context. It's ok to copy/paste code from somewhere, we all do. If you did or if you followed random tutorial, add the link to the pull request (or in a comment in the code).
* Keep the git log clean.
  * 1 commit for the requested changes. Reviewers don't want to go through 20 commits to see changes you did
  * `git rebase` and `git commit --amend --no-edit` are your friends
  * If your PR got several commits, consider squashing (squash and merge)

### For the reviewer

* Don't do someone else's job. 
  * "You forget a semicolon" => Stop. It's worthless because it's a robot job, not a human job. 
  * "Tests are failing" => Same. We have robot for that.
* Prefix Nitpicking comments with "nit" or "nitpicking".
* The code review's author is not a piñata. So, don't be a jerk.
  * Avoid: "your code is unreadable".
  * Prefer proposing alternative implementations "You can also split this code into 2 different functions. What do you think about?" (assume the author already considered them)
* Ask for clarification. ("I didn't understand xxx. Can you clarify?"). Do it, even if the PR had already been approved by someone else.
* Remember that you are here to provide feedback, not to be a gatekeeper.
* Remember that **behind each Pull Request, there's a human who spent time to write this code** (the size of the PR is not necessarily correlated to the time spent on it).



## List of valid reasons to 👎 a PR

* (none)

Declining a PR can be really harsh for the author. It should be the very last call. Favor 1-to-1 conversation instead and let the author decline his own PR or do the changes.

If the pull request bring something you consider harmful for the project, you can add an "🚨" emoji to prevent the merge.

## Tips for better code review

* Use the hide whitespace option.
* If your PR is not ready, mark it as WIP (prefix it with `WIP:`). Don't waste someone else time!
* Asking junior to review your code first. If a junior
