Earlier this year, I wrote a post where I mentioned how inefficient it is to build your own design
system in 2021. As expected, it gave some people had knee-jerk reaction.

## "It ends up with an unpolished look and feel"

I'm making app for +10y now and, I'm still surprised to see how many companies have their own
implementation of a god damn button. Back in the days, developpers were crazy about creating their
PHP framework. In 2021, we're still reinventing the wheel with our UI.

Let's be honest. Your application UI is not that specific. Whatever our ego would love to think, an
application is not a piece of art. User don't go there just for to see the beauty of what CSS can
offer. People use the app because it fixes problems.

Don't you recognize anything?

Bootstrap 2.0. Everywhere! And their app was: making tons of money, loved by many developers, ranked
in the top 100 of the most visited websites. Oh, and they also got acquired by Microsoft for $7.5
billion.

Instead of satisfying our ego we were focusing more on the product?

## Your custom design system is probably not accessible

Accessibility (a11y) is complicated. I understand that buttons components can be straightforward to
implement. It's another story when it comes to modals, dropdowns, alerts... Keyboard navigation,
focus, component's state are more complex. And not everyone is aware of some screen readers and how
to use them.

By the way, if you never used a screen reader, I bet your components are not accessible.

If your design system is built on the top of a battle-tested library, you can't be sure that it's
accessible.

## "Yeah but, libraries have limitations!"

In my actual company we also had this discussion about design system. When I suggested to build our
own design system on the top of an open-source component library, a developer mentioned that these
libraries may have limitations. Which is a fair point.

Again, you sure your application is that unique? Also, ask yourself: _"Can I live with this missing
feature or not? Is there is an alternative component? What is the impact on the business side?"_. Is
this missing feature is important enough to invest days of design&developement? (with all hidden
costs like testing, maintenance & documentation).

If you're in a company that employs many developers, why not. But if you're in a startups/mid-sized
companies, I don't think you should.
