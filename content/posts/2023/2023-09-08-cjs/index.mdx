import Info from '../../../../src/components/MDX/Info'

I faced a problem recently. I have a reference data package which is an npm package that can be
consumed by two different projects:

- The frontend: a React application bundled with Vite.js, an ESM builder (with no CJS support).
- The backend: a Nestjs application that only supports CommonJS.

Also, this package contains some big files inside. Bundling everything in one file is a big no-no.

<Info title="ðŸ’¡ ESM? CJS? Whatâ€™s that?">
  <p>CommonJS (CJS) is the older and traditional way of dealing with JS dependencies.</p>
  <p>ESM (ECMAScript Modules) is the official standard format to package JavaScript.</p>
</Info>

```tsx
// CommonJS (CJS)
const path = require('path')
module.exports = path.extname('index.html')

// ESM (ECMAScript Modules)
import path from 'path'
export default path.extname('index.html')
```

## Folder structure

Let's start with a classic file architecture:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ dist
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ function-a.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ function-b.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.esm.json
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.cjs.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

Please note that everything under the `src/` folder import/export dependencies with the ES7 `import`
/ `export` keyword.

## Library's package.json

The solution I found is to have 2 folders under the `dist` folder:

```json
{
  "name": "@maxpou/my-cool-package",
  "main": "dist/cjs/index.js",
  "exports": {
    "require": "./dist/cjs/index.js",
    "import": "./dist/esm/index.js"
  },
  "files": ["README.md", "dist"],
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm run build:cjs && npm run build:esm",
    "build:cjs": "tsc -p tsconfig.cjs.json",
    "build:esm": "tsc -p tsconfig.esm.json"
  }
}
```

You can see that I use the `exports` token. This allows the package owner to define multiple entry
points. A CommonJS system will use the index located in the `./dist/cjs/index.js` folder while an
ESM system will use the other index located in the _esm_ folder.

By the way, you can do
[much more with the conditional exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports)!

## tsconfig.json files

I don't have one file but two.

```jsx{5-6}
// tsconfig.esm.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "esnext",
    "module": "esnext",
    "outDir": "./dist/esm",
    // ...
  },
  "include": ["src/index.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

```jsx{5-6}
// tsconfig.cjs.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2017",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "./dist/cjs",
    // ...
  },
  "include": ["src/index.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

If your IDE or other tools need one named `tsconfig.json`, you can create a master one. Then the
specific tsconfig files can extend from it.

Then you can `npm publish` and call it a day ðŸ¥³

## Usage

Your package will be available in both ESM and CommonJS environments. Your users can use it without
knowing there's a separation.

```ts
// ESM
import { myFunction } from 'my-cool-package'

// CommonJS
const { myFunction } = require('my-cool-package')
```
