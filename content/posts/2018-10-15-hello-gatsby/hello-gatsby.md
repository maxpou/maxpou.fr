Two months ago, I was in the DublinJS meetup. As usual, the talk I came for, wasn't the most interesting one. The talk about [ember-ghost](https://github.com/stonecircle/ember-ghost) completely blew my mind. The speaker shows a static generation website using Ember (JavaScript). It seems that Jekyll doesn't have the had the monopoly anymore!

By using static generation website in JS, I could take leverage of awesome tools like Webpack (hot reload), componentization...

## Jekyll pro and cons

I have been running my blog under Jekyll for 3 years. I don't want to blame this tool, my needs have evolved.

What I like:
- hosted on GitHub for free. The only thing I pay is the domain name *maxpou.fr* (~6€/year)
- **"backend-less"**! Everything is fully static. I don't want to rely on a DB for a blog!
- Simple to use. There's no over complicated administration panel... well, there's no administration at all!
- I write my post in markdown in my IDE. Then, I `git commit` and `git push` to master to publish my article!
- ...people can submit PR to fix a typo somewhere (let's be honest: nobody did 😂).
- The theme I use. I like what [@mmistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes) did for the [hpstr-jekyll-theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme)!
- it's easy to "pimp" a theme without any Ruby skills!
- Good performances (lighthouse)
- MIT License

What I don't like:
- I don't want to install ruby locally. It's mandatory to get it when working on site structure;
- Jekyll watch mode is slow, even more with docker (2/3 sec to detect a change + 2 sec to recompile everything 😴)
- Adding plugins is very complicated. Once, I tried to change the syntax highlighting plugin (Jekyll handle markdown to HTML conversion). I spent something like 4 hours, without success. I finally drop this idea...
- Service worker management  => ☠️. I lost a lot of hairs when trying to make Workbox working... without success!


## 🎅 Dear Santa, for my next blog I want...

- Ideally, keep all the thing I like an remove the ones I dislike 😃
- Something easy to install/configure
- Get a static build to deploy on GitHub Pages
- I'm working on a day to day with Vue.js. So, it could be nice if it's something different: React, Ember...
- If possible, keep my Disqus comments!
- ... and something that works beyond the classic "getting started" (i.e. manage pagination, ability to add new feature...)!

## 🏆 Candidates

Tools I tried:

* [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org). Good to generate documentation... but there's currently no support for blogging. Plus I'm already working with Vue.js.
* [Ember-Ghost](https://github.com/stonecircle/ember-ghost): Looks promising! Unfortunately, I had local issues with Ember or Node. I still don't know! (shame, I could have asked the maintainer, I know him!)
* [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org): Gatsby is a React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator.


## 🎉 And the winner is... Gastby!

*(I hope it's not a big surprise, it was in the post's title ;) )*

Pros:
* I ❤️ GraphQL. It's very intuitive! (except when you try to do some custom filters!)
* React is cool. React 16 is even more!
* Looks like Vue.js
* The hot reload is very fast (thanks to Webpack 4)

Cons:
* There is some magic... and I don't like magic. I'm missing a plain old router to match routes with pages. Also, the [`gatsby-node.js` file](https://github.com/maxpou/maxpou.fr/blob/master/gatsby-node.js) is not immediately obvious. 
* The [starter library](http://gatsbyjs.org/starters) is not very consistent. And most of the starters look like "hello world" project.
* Some small issues with cache invalidation
* ... and that's it!!!

If you want to know the difference between Gatsby and Jekyll, there is a comparative table on [Gatsby's website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/features/).

Now let's find the starter:
* [gatsby-starter-casper](https://github.com/haysclark/gatsby-starter-casper): looks very nice but use the v1 of Gatsby. I want to start with something on the cutting edge of technology.
* [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog): a very minimalist blog. Far away from what I want.
* ...start from scratch?!

I finally opt with the last 2 solutions.

## 🎊 Introducing gatsby-starter-morning-dew

Yes! I did it! I Created my own starter!!! I called it **gatsby-starter-morning-dew**. 
Why? Well, check out the list of available starters:

![available starters](./gatsby-starters.png)

At the moment, there are only 3 available starters for blogging in markdown (the first one is mine 😎). So, **adding an extra one could be a real benefit for the community**!

Before migrating this blog to a new one, I wanted to release the starter first. It took me two months to get something good. And now I'm very happy with the result.

![git addition / deletion](./additions-deletions.png)
<center><i>I removed 9 000 line of code for this new blog!</i></center>

The full list of features is available on the [starter's README](https://github.com/maxpou/gatsby-starter-morning-dew). In a nutshell:

* **Markdown:** I still write my post and pages in markdown. There is syntax highlighting syntax colour and easily configurable. 
* **Configuration:** I don't want people to worry about the internals. That's why almost everything is configurable through a JS config file!
* **CSS:** Because I don't want to rely on a framework, I wrote 100% of the CSS! (...I also stole fragments 😇)
* **Mobile friendly&PWA**. I felt guilty. I deliver a few talks about Progressive Web Apps and my own website wasn't PWA compliant... shame! solved!
* Clear separation between data (posts) and application structures (components, css)
* ... and many other things!

## 🗺 What's next?

I have a lot of ideas for the next:

* manage **pagination**: 25 articles to list is a bit too much for a hello page.
* **css-in-js**: To be honest, I miss the Vuejs's `<style lang="scss" scoped>` tag. I saw different React approaches and I like none of them. Maybe if I try one, I'll change my mind? Let see...
* enable **RSS feed**;
* **Markdown syntax checker**. At the moment, it's hard to spot a missing header in a markdown file. And the message in the console isn't very helpful;
* clean up the code.
