This is an easy-to-prepare dish that I like to prepare when I have limited time.

## Ingredients (2 persons)

- 3x Tomatoes
- 260g Beans (1 can)
- Parsley
- Garlic (4 cloves)
- 1 cayenne pepper

## Steps

1. In a pan, add some neutral oil. Once it’s hot add the diced garlic. Cook for 3mins.
2. While it’s cooking, dice the tomatoes and chop the cayenne pepper.
3. Add the tomatoes, the pepper, the beans and 50ml of water.
4. Cook until water is reduced and the sauce has the right consistency.
5. When it’s ready, add the parsley and season with salt and pepper.
