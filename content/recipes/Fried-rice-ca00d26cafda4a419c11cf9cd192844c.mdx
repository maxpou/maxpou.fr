I usually do this recipe when I want to finish what’s in the fridge. That’s why most of the
ingredients are optional.

## Base ingredients

- Rice
- Egg ~ 1 per person
- 3 cloves of garlic
- Soy sauce
- Parsley

## Optional ingredients

- Peas
- Chilli pepper
- Broccoli
- Ginger
- Red pepper

## Steps

1. in a pan make an omelette with the egg. Once it’s ready, remove it from the pan. Chop it roughly.
2. in the same pan (now empty), add garlic
3. then add your veggies (pepper/broccoli/…)
4. when it’s cooked, add the rice and the egg(s)
5. add the soy sauce
6. add some pepper and the parsley
7. serve!
