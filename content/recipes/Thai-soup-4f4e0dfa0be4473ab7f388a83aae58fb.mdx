Thai soups (or _“tom kha kai”_) are often made with chicken or shrimp. This one is a vegetarian
version. Most of the ingredients are optional because this is one of my go-to dishes to empty my
fridge of vegetables.

## Ingredients

The basics:

- 1 can of Coco milk
- vegetable stock (the equivalent of the coconut milk can)
- 1 tablespoon of curry paste (red/green)
- 1 tablespoon of grated ginger
- fresh cilantro
- lime juice (~1 lime)
- fish sauce (1 teaspoon)
- lemongrass
- [Optional] 1 cayenne pepper (or half)

The veggies: (aka pick what you have in the fridge!)

- brown mushroom/shiitake
- 1 tomato
- 1 oignon
- 1 Carrot
- 1 Bell pepper
- Tofu

## Steps

1. Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the ginger and cook for 30
   seconds. Add the curry paste and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
2. Add the lemongrass, coconut milk, vegetable stock, lime juice and fish sauce. Bring to a
   boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.
3. Add the vegetables and cook for 5-7 minutes, until everything is fully cooked.
4. Garnish with cilantro and serve immediately with a bowl of rice.
