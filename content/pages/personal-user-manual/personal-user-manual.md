Hey, I'm Maxence. You can also call me Max if you want. The following contains a user guide for me
and how I like to work. This is also what people call "Personal README".

## North Star Principles

- Humans come first.
- Diversity and inclusion.
- Work-life balance.
- _"Actions speak louder than words"_.

## My Work Preferences\*

_\* As mentioned above, this list sums up the way I like to work. It is absolutely not here to set
expectations._

- **Asynchronous communication**. Notifications are my productivity killer. They are always switched
  off. That's why I am more "offline" than the average. It allows me to do deep work sessions, free
  of distractions.
- **Home office**. [My work setup](/uses) is very minimalistic and nomad-friendly. It's common to
  see me with different backgrounds during remote meetings. I find myself more productive working
  from different places (co-working space, cafe, library...).
- **Direct vs. Indirect communication**: Some people do their best to avoid disagreements and prefer
  a more indirect form of communication. **I don't.** I like "healthy disagreements" and I think
  they are a normal part of relating to others.
- **Emails**. I'm not good at checking my emails. If I'm too slow to respond, please reach me on
  Slack.
- **Meetings**. I like when they are timeboxed and organised beforehand. That means, I appreciate
  knowing before the meeting what it is about and if something is expected from me.
- **Transparency**. I'm very transparent about my activities. There are days where I'm less
  productive and I'm perfectly fine with that. I don't like to feel the need to fake my online
  activity.
- **Words matter**. I believe words like _"simple"_, _"just"_, _"of course"_, _"everyone knows"_ and
  _"easy"_ should stay out of technical conversations. They can often be perceived as
  [offensive](https://css-tricks.com/words-avoid-educational-writing/). Also, I don't think they
  provide much value.

## Oddities

- **OCD** _(Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder)_: I have an eye to spot unnecessary things like a
  paragraph with 2 different fonts. The same goes for technical stuff (irregularities in variables
  name casing, etc.). When it happens I usually do a sneaky fix and no one notices.
- **Language**: English is not my mother tongue. I may say the exact opposite of what I think at the
  moment. I also love expressions which I learn outside work (films, blogs...). If I use something
  offensive or inappropriate, please let me know. It's probably unintentional.
- **Bullet list**: I tend to overuse bullet lists. It's the perfect way to communicate with me (as
  long as it's not an endless list). If it's a trigger for you, please let me know.

I forgot one point: **Feedback**. I love to receiving feedback so I can improve. If you have to give
me feedback, please go straight to the point.
