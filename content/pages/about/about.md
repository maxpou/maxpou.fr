## Hello World!

Hey, I'm **Maxence Poutord**, passionate software engineer, speaker, blogger and [mentor](https://mentors.codingcoach.io/?name=Maxence+Poutord).
I started coding [in my early age, at 11](https://twitter.com/_maxpou/status/771701472199340032) with the QBasic language. 19 years later, I'm still coding (I just hope my code is better 😃).

After 2 years as an expat in Dublin, I became a digital nomad. I now live where the WiFi and the sun is 😎

## What I do for a living

I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at [VSware](http://vsware.ie/) where I am building software for education. I'm focusing on:

* **🏗 Architecture**. Scaling application, organising workflows.
* **🧙‍♂️ Simplify** complex process and make my co-worker's life easier.
* **🚦 Test**. Defining strategies to **effectively** test a web app.
* **💎 Code quality**. I ❤️ crafting code.
* **🏎 Performances**. Because users want something fast!
* **[🗣 Tech trainer](./speaking#trainings--workshop)** and **[public speaker](./speaking)**.


## What I do for fun

* ✈️ **Travel**. Often. 9 countries and 14 cities for 2018.
* 👨‍🍳 **Cook**. "I make the best pizza you ever tasted." -Me
* 🍺 Appreciate a Gin or a **pint of beer** (IPA or Belgian triples).
* 📘 Learn new things. As a **lifelong learner**, I can't imagine one day without learning something new!
* 👨🏼‍💻 **Play with code**. Sometimes, it ends up in an open source contribution or a blog post!
