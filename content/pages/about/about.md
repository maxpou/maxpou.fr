## Hello World!

I am **Maxence Poutord**, a French 28 years old Software Engineer. I started coding at the age of 11 with the QBasic language. I finished my studies with a Master Degree in Computer Science.  
After some times in France, I've decided to move in Ireland for a new challenge.

Today I consider myself as a **Software craftsman**, a **lifelong learner** and a **web technologies enthusiast**. I am also interested in all aspects of web applications. Whether through their architecture, their interactions with each other and humans who produce and consume them.

I'm also an (ex?) biker ([Yamaha MT-03]({{ site.url }}/images/mt03.jpg)).
