## Hello World!

![a picture of me](../../images/me.jpeg)

Hey, I'm **Maxence Poutord**, passionate software engineer, speaker, blogger and
[mentor](https://mentors.codingcoach.io/?name=Maxence+Poutord). I started coding
[in my early age, at 11](https://twitter.com/_maxpou/status/771701472199340032) with the QBasic
language. And, +20 years later, I'm still coding!

After 2 years as an expat in Dublin, I became a digital nomad. I started working and living where
the WiFi and the sun are (mostly in Southeast Asia). I'm now settled in Paris and I still work
remotely.

## What I do for a living

I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at Orderfox where I am building software for the CNC
industry. I'm focusing on:

- **🏗 Architecture/Infrastructure** of a React application (working with TS and GraphQL);
- **🚦 Testing** (mostly with Jest, Cypress and Testing Library);
- **👨‍🦯 Accessibility (a11y)**
- **🏎 Performances**.

## What I do for fun

- ✈️ **Travel**. Often.
- 👨‍🍳 **[Cook](/kitchen)**. I love to cook food from all over the world. From Italian Pizza to Indian
  dal.
- 🍺 Appreciate a Gin or a **pint of beer** (IPA/NEIPA).
- 🕹 **Play** video games. Mostly Age of Empires 2, a 20 y.o. game!
- 📘 Learn new things. As a **lifelong learner**, I can't imagine one day without learning something
  new!
- **🗣 [Tech trainer](./speaking#trainings--workshop)** and **[public speaker](./speaking)**.
- 👨🏼‍💻 **Play with code**. Sometimes, it ends up in an open source contribution or a blog post!

## Why this blog?

I started this blog in 2014 because I wanted to keep track of my experiements. At the begining, it
was all private. I learnt a lot on the internets so, I realised I had to give something back to the
community. That's why, I decided to make it public in order to share my knowledge to the world.

**My site has no ads, sponsored content or bullshit. It is my blog, my content and my ideas.**
